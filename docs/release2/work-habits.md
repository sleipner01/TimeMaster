# Work habits

### Habits
We decided to mostly sit together when working on the project, as this would ensure that we could ask each other questions and keep everyone updated on the work we were doing. We have usually met up two days a week, and sometimes done some work i between. 

As most of us is not experienced with using git, we decided to usually merge to master when we were all together.

We created a new branch for working on a new issue. We then pulled master to the branch when we were happy with our work, and made a new merge request. This merge request needed to be approved, preferably by another team-member, before merging to master. This ensures that the master is always working.

In this release we have mostly focused on configuration and set-up of the project and modules. We have assigned issues to each person, and that person asked for help or input when needed. We have tried to make sure that asking for help is always encouraged, and have discussed different solutions with each other. When we have implemented the solutions to the issues, or expanded the classes or IU, we have worked in pairs.

### Code quality
We decided to use Google's standard for checking the quality of our code with Checkstyle. We have tested parts of the code as we were working, but decided to do a final quality check of the code when we were mostly done, as we haven't been able to use Checkstyle from the beginning of this sprint. Before starting the next sprint we will make sure that everyone knows the practices we should follow when coding, and check the Checkstyle-report often. This will make sure that we follow the same conventions, and makes the code easier to use.
