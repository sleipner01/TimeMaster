# Work habits

### Habits
We decided to mostly sit together when working on the project, as this would ensure that we could ask each other questions and keeping everyone updated on the work we were doing. We have met up two days a week, and done some work i between. 

As most of us is not experienced with using git, we decided to usually merge to master when we were all together.

### Code quality
We decided to use Google's standard for checking the quality of our code with Checkstyle. We have tested parts of the code as we were working, but decided to do a final quality check of the code when we were mostly done, as we haven't been able to use Checkstyle from the beginning of this sprint. Before starting the next sprint we will make sure that everyone knows the practices we should follow when coding, and check the Checkstyle-report often.
